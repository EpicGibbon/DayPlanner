# DayPlanner
### My first DayPlanner application!
For this assignment we were tasked with making a DayPlanner that is interactive with the time at the top of the page. When you're entering your information, the blocks are supposed to be color coorindated with the time. It is fully functional and also has the ability to store the text inside the blank field to the local storage. 

## Functionality 
- Grey means time has past
- Red means you're currently within that timeslot
- Green means that the timeslot is in the future

## Verision 
This is V1.0, there will be updates coming in the future to finalize this application!
